<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<p>
The <i>Biophysical Processor LANDSAT8</i> is optimized to use a LANDSAT8 product as input instead of a Sentinel2 product, however it is only capable of computing <i>LAI</i>, <i>FAPAR</i> and <i>FVC</i> indexes.
</p>

<h4>Additional user actions for LANDSAT8 C2</h4>
<p>
LANDSAT8 Collection 2 does not provide the zenith and azimuth angles for L2 products. To use the Biophysical operator on these products, the 4 bands must be added first.
</p>
<p>
Steps:
<ol>
    <p class="i1">
        1. Download both the Level 1 and Level 2 products for the same image.
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        2. Copy the four total sun and view azimuth files from Level 1 folder (the four TIFs ending in <i>_SZA.tif</i>, <i>_SAA.tif</i>, <i>_VAA.tif</i>, <i>_VZA.tif</i>) to Level 2 folder.
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        3. Copy the information for these four layers in the Level 1 metadata file (ending in ?_MTL.txt?), and paste it into the Level 2 metadata file. The four new bands will be loaded in SNAP as <i>vaa</i>, <i>vza</i>, <i>saa</i>, and <i>sza</i>.
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        4. The DN values of the angles are scaled by 100, so we need to apply the Band Maths operator to multiply them by 0.01. The new 4 bands will be:
        <ul>
            <li class="i2">view_azimuth_mean = vaa * 0.01</li>
            <li class="i2">view_zenith_mean = vza * 0.01</li>
            <li class="i2">sun_azimuth = saa * 0.01</li>
            <li class="i2">sun_zenith = sza * 0.01</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    be a LANDSAT8 product. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the application.
    The algorithm is calibrated for top-of-canopy reflectances and depends
    on the acquisition geometry, so it requires slope-effect corrected reflectances
    to give optimal results
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the application.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened automatically.
</p>

<h4>Processing Parameters Tab</h4>

<ol>
    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute LAI: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of LAI (Leaf Area Index) in the output product
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute FAPAR: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) in the output product
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute FVC: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of FVC (Fraction of Vegetation Cover) in the output product
    </p>
</ol>
